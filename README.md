## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key

### Setup

1. **Get an Anthropic API Key**:
   - Visit [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Sign up and create an account
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key (starts with 'sk-ant-')

2. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ela-tutor-chatbot
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Anthropic API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```
   - **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control!

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to view it in the browser.

## How It Works

### API Integration
- Uses Anthropic's Claude API directly via the `@ai-sdk/anthropic` package
- Maintains conversation context across messages
- Enforces academic integrity rules through system prompts
- Provides educational fallback responses when API is unavailable

### Error Handling
- **Missing API Key**: Provides clear setup instructions
- **Authentication Errors**: Guides users to check their API key
- **Rate Limits**: Handles API rate limiting gracefully
- **Connection Issues**: Falls back to educational resources

## Academic Integrity Features

The chatbot includes robust protections against academic dishonesty:

- **Writing Request Detection**: Automatically detects when students ask for writing help
- **Ethical Redirection**: Redirects writing requests to brainstorming and process guidance
- **Educational Focus**: Emphasizes learning and skill development over content generation
- **Process-Oriented Help**: Focuses on teaching the writing process, not doing the writing
- **System Prompt Safeguards**: Claude is instructed to never complete assignments

## Usage

1. **Set up API Key**: Configure your Anthropic API key in the `.env` file
2. **Start Learning**: Ask questions about ELA topics
3. **Use Topic Shortcuts**: Quick access to different subjects
4. **Follow Suggestions**: Click suggestion buttons for related topics
5. **Academic Integrity**: The bot will guide you through learning, not do work for you
